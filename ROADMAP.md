# Roadmap

What ships in which version. Unlike `BACKLOG.md` (an unordered pool of
things we might want), this file is about sequencing: what's already out,
and what's committed to for the next release. An item only belongs here
once it's actually been assigned to a version — until then it stays in the
backlog.

## v0.1 — shipped (2026-08-14)

- YAML schema and validation, with a high-level `scenes:` compiler on top
  of the low-level track/clip model.
- Deterministic `.kdenlive` (MLT XML) generation.
- Reverse importer, `.kdenlive` -> YAML, preserving unrecognized elements
  under `x_kdenlive_raw` instead of discarding them.
- CLI: `kdgen build` / `validate` / `import`.
- i18n message catalog for user-facing output (`en`/`es`, via `KDGEN_LANG`).
- Example project with tiny committed assets (`examples/simple/`).

## v0.2 — not yet scoped

Nothing committed to yet. Candidates live in `BACKLOG.md` until we decide
what actually goes in this release.
